Confluent Cloud Unreachable
***************************

In the ``producer`` container, add a rule blocking network traffic that has a destination TCP port ``9092``. This will prevent the producer from reaching the |ak| cluster in |ccloud|.

This scenario will look at |ccloud| metrics from the Metrics API and client metrics from the client application's MBean object ``kafka.producer:type=producer-metrics,client-id=producer-1``.

Introduce failure scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Add a rule blocking traffic in the ``producer`` container on port ``9092`` which is used to talk to the broker:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose exec producer iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 9092 -j DROP

Diagnose the problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. includes: ../includes/produce-failures.rst

Resolve failure scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Remove the rule we created earlier that blocked traffic with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose exec producer iptables -D OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 9092 -j DROP

#. It may take a few minutes for the producer to start sending requests again.


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Producer output rate doesn't come back up after adding in the ``iptables`` rule.

   Restart the producer by running ``docker-compose restart producer``. This is advice specific to this tutorial.

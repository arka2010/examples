Authorization Revoked
*********************

Using the |ccloud| CLI, revoke the producer's authorization to write to the topic.

This scenario will look at |ccloud| metrics from the Metrics API and client metrics from the client application's MBean object ``kafka.producer:type=producer-metrics,client-id=producer-1``.

Introduce failure scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Delete the ACL allowing write to the topic, inserting your service account ID instead of ``184498``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ccloud kafka acl delete --service-account 184498 --operation write  --topic '*' --allow

Diagnose the problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. includes: ../includes/produce-failures.rst

#. Check the producer logs for more information about what is going wrong. Use the following docker command to get the producer logs:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker-compose logs producer

#. Verify that you see log messages similar to what is shown below:

   .. code-block:: text

      WHAT? No AuthZ errors?

   Note that the logs provide a clear picture of what is going on--``Error: NETWORK_EXCEPTION`` and ``server disconnected``. This was expected because the failure scenario we introduced blocked outgoing traffic to the broker's port. Looking at metrics alone won't always lead you directly to an answer but they are a quick way to see if things are working as expected.

Resolve failure scenario
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Add the ACL allowing write to the topic, inserting your service account ID instead of ``184498``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ccloud kafka acl add --service-account 184498 --operation write  --topic '*' --allow
